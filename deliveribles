Based on the details provided,
here are a few things you may need to complete this project:


Entity classes for Cities, Passengers, Airports, and Aircraft with fields and relationships defined as JPA entities.
Interface repositories extending JpaRepository for each entity.
A RepositoryRestResource class for each entity exposing CRUD operations via REST.
Application class annotated with @SpringBootApplication.
Application properties configuring database, port, etc.
pom.xml dependencies for Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST.
Dockerfile to build a container image for the application.
docker-compose.yml to define and run services.
Test data initialization via data.sql or @Entity listeners.
Postman tests for CRUD operations on each entity.
Some things to focus on are defining the entity relationships
 correctly, exposing CRUD via RepositoryRestResource,
 and verifying functionality by running in Docker.
 Let me know if any part needs more explanation or
 code samples. Proper setup of Spring Boot, JPA, REST
 and Docker is key to success on this project.
